I didn't run
'npx expo run:android'
because I don't have the Android SDK installed in my computer;

I just ran
npx expo prebuild

On
npx expo run:android
It started with a bunch of errors of
"Error: could not connect to TCP port 5554: cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:5554:..."

Running the command again the error didn't happen anymore (?)
But then, the error was:
'Android Gradle plugin requires Java 17 to run. You are currently using Java 11'
Solved by
'changing `org.gradle.java.home` in `gradle.properties`.'
pointing to a jdk 17.

Then the error was:
'SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable
or by setting the sdk.dir path in your project's local properties file at...'

And all this happened because:
'npx expo run:android requires Android Studio and Java to be installed and configured on your computer.'
